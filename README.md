# Appy Christmas

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/psapnvypec32jwm1/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/frozenskys/appy-christmas/branch/master)

Mobile App Development Challange

1. Fork this repository and clone a local copy
1. Run `cake.cmd` to build and start the backend api
1. Pick one of the technologies from below
1. Write a simple app that calls the backend api and displays the information sent back - it should contain the following pages:
* Branded "Loading" page
* Product List page
* Product detail page
1. Work out how to test the app
1. Write up the learnings, pros\cons, license costs etc.

There are included assets to get you started but you can supplement these if you wish.

## The Backend API

Running `cake` from the commandline will build and spin up a simple aspnet core api with the following endpoints

* `http://localhost:5000/api/products/` - this will return a list of products
* `http://localhost:5000/api/products/{x}/` - this will return the product with the id of x (zero based remember!)
* `http://localhost:5000/swagger/ui/index.html`  - a swagger ui page allowing you to test the api.

**You will probably need to install the [.NET Core 1.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) to be able to run this locally.**

The product list is just hard coded into the `getProducts()` method

If you want something that is DB backed then try the entityframework branch

The public URL for this API is <http://appychristmas.azurewebsites.net/api/products/> with the swagger endpoint available here <http://appychristmas.azurewebsites.net/swagger/ui/index.html>

## The Technologies

### Cross Platform

* Ionic
* Xamarin
* Cordova

### Platform Specific

* UWP

### WebApp Based

* Angular
* DOJO

### Less Interesting

* iOS
* Android
* jQuery Mobile

## Deploy your own endpoint

If you'd like to setup a CD pipeline and host your own copy of this endpoint you can sign up for [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) for free
which will link to your github fork of this repo and build the dotnet api for you. If you sign up for a free [Azure](https://portal.azure.com) account you can
host this as an API service for free and configure AppVeyor to publish to your Azure service. The key to this is changing the deploy details in the AppVeyor.yml.

If you want to edit this in VS2015 or VS2017 then you will need to install the [.NET Core VS Tools Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core).
